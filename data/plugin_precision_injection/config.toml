# A dictionary for assigning injection locations to specific files.
# Files not assigned a location will be injected by default when
# the `inject.html` partial is invoked with an empty location value.
# How locations are named and assigned is entirely up to you, as you 
# will be the one passing them as parameters when invoking the partial
# from your theme or plugin to inject the associated file list.
#
# Here's how mine happens to look:
# [Locations]
# HEAD_TOP = [ "google-tag-manager-head-script.html" ]
# ABOVE_HEADER = [ "google-tag-manager-header-script.html" ]
#
[Locations]
# HEAD_TOP = []
# ABOVE_HEADER = []
# BELOW_HEADER = []
# FOOTER = []
# BELOW_FOOTER = []

# A dictionary for restricting a file's injection by page path.
# When an plugin include appears as a key in this dictionary,
# it will only be injected into page's whose path has been
# included in the assigned list.
#
# Here's how mine looks:
# [Filters]
# "category-cloud-style.html" = [ "/cloud/" ]
# "/assets/css/gallery.css" = [ "/gallery/" ]
# "/assets/css/bookshelves.css" = [ "/bookshelf/" ]
# "/assets/js/bookshelves.js" = [ "/bookshelf/" ]
